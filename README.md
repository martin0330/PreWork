App I would like to build:
A social media app that caters to books. Focus on "influencers" like Jay Shetty or Ryan Holiday where they can show their favorite books or what books they are currently reading. Goal is to learn as much as you can about a person through the books that they read. Can have features that allows communities to talk about the book and share the lessons they learned
